**My Linux config files**
I am trying to use
[StreakyCobra's](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11071754)
method to store config files in a bare git repo.
[Nicola Paolucci](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/)
has a nice blog post about the method.
